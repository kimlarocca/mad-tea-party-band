        <div class="bubble">I have had the pleasure of working with Kim for the last year and a half. She is a
            perfectionist that will only deliver her best every time. As an SEO Content Manager I have worked closely
            with Kim on several projects. From implementing video on the site to optimizing Mobile to be responsive she
            is always there with efficient, streamlined solutions. Thinking out of the box is her specialty. I'm
            grateful to have worked with her at ToysRUs as Kim would be a tremendous asset to any team!

        <div class="bubble">Kim is an absolute pleasure to work for. She is always on top of every project that everyone
            is working on, and I know if I ask her a question I’ll get an answer. She is a great project manager not
            only in that she makes sure every project gets done as efficiently and as well as possible, but also that
            the people doing the projects are working on things that they enjoy doing! She's always pushing us to do our
            best and helping us move forward in our careers and in our skill levels. Kim is a great boss - probably my
            favorite boss I've ever had :)

        <div class="bubble">Kim built a tool for the Great Deals Stores that is easy to use and has been an important
            asset to our team. Simply put, it is awesome! The Great Deals store is important for our company to showcase
            our best digital promotions for Toys”R”Us and Babies”R”Us. Creating these stores were very time consuming
            until this new tool. We are now able to copy all our deals into spreadsheets that can easily be loaded into
            the system. We can generate test links that look exactly like the deal stores, and can manipulate the dates
            to see time specific deals fall in and out of the store – a feature that is very necessary for tracking our
            deals during season. The GDS tool has been great for our team, has prevented us from waking up at 6am every
            morning to check the deals and has fostered trust in our team that the stores will go live every week.

        <div class="bubble">I recently had a had glitch with my e-mail program and quite a few messages were lost. How
            fortunate I am to have the On-Line Lead Manager database, otherwise all those leads would have been
            permanently lost. I am grateful that my web site is hosted with Kim.

        <div class="bubble">The site is absolutely wonderful and has gone beyond my hopes. Thank you so much. With out
            you guys I would not be doing the business I am doing. It is worth every penny I paid for the site and some.
            You are so helpful ... Kim you have a great career ahead of you if you treat every customer the way you
            treat me.

        <div class="bubble">I hired Kim as a Senior Web Developer at Toys”R”Us. She’s always eager to work on new
            projects where her coding skills are best displayed. Kim lead many high-profile development projects to
            helped to drive user engagement and conversion. Beyond that, Kim is always looking for ways to apply her
            programming know-how towards improving the team’s operation efficiency. She created tools that aided with
            cross-functional team collaboration and improved merchandising updates. This had a direct impact to project
            KPIs, including revenue growth. Kim is an asset and would make a great addition to any company that’s lucky
            to have her.

        <div class="bubble">WOW!!! You're the Super Best!!! Thank you so much for putting it together so quickly. If I
            had a winning race horse, I would name her KIM!

        </div>
        <div class="bubble">I will be delighted to give you an outstanding reference. The fact that you can maintain
            your patience and professionalism speaks well for you. I won’t go into details while I expound on the
            variety of services you offer, your consistency and your dedication to support your client needs.

        </div>
        <div class="bubble">Kim, thanks for your help. You have no idea what a continual relief it is to me to just be
            able to ask you questions like this. I'll gladly refer anyone I know to you at any time. I cannot tell you
            how pleased we are, both with the website, and with you... I have nothing to say but good things about you.
            I can't think of a single negative experience we've ever had since you took over our website, and many times
            you have gone way beyond in helping me with my lack of technological abilities. We will be glad to be a
            reference for you anytime. By the way, I was thinking today that I almost think it was worth losing $2000 to
            that idiot company to have you instead.

        <div class="bubble">I LOVE MY WEBSITE! You are so creative! Thank you for helping me. I'm so glad I found your

        <div class="bubble">Exuberant, supportive and motivating. Those are the words that I would use to describe Kim
            and her role at W2O Group, where I have reported to her for over 2 years.
            <br><br>
            I've watched Kim define her role as Senior Director of Development and give that title true meaning. I've
            been privileged to witness her taking the time to instruct junior members on language constructs, code
            quality, navigating the workplace or any of a myriad other tasks, all of which she does with patience and
            grace, never too busy to help someone out. She has also proven herself adept and willing to jump on any task
            and get 'elbow deep' into whatever project needs to get done, regardless of the time frame or effort
            involved. Often times, this willingness means coding herself, facilitating others or simply providing moral
            support. She has also proven an adept and capable manager, fighting for her team as a whole or individuals
            in particular, with conviction and the knowledge to defend them admirably.
            <br><br>
            Aside from her coding and managerial skills, Kim brings a cohesiveness and humanity to the office which is
            welcome and very much appreciated. She is always first with a smile and greeting and eager to generate
            camaraderie and promote team building during and after hours.
            <br><br>
            I'm more than happy to recommend Kim, for any position and would consider it a pleasure to be able to work
            with her, in any capacity.

        <div class="bubble">Thank you, thank you. By the way, the site looks great and the control panel looks pretty
            user friendly.
            <small>- Patty Johnson, client</small>
        </div>
        <div class="bubble">Kim is an exemplary employee who is extremely dependable and hard working. She is a go-
            getter who will always get the job done on task and on-time.

        </div>
        <div class="bubble">Kim has established an outstanding web design company with quite a large client base because
            of three major principles: 1) A thorough understanding of the industry sectors she designs for. 2) The
            creation of dynamic database driven sites, which allow for a rich user experience. 3) Real-time client help.

        <div class="bubble">Good evening, Tony. I've been meaning to take a moment to write you a letter. I'm glad to
            say that I've been busy and that is why I haven't sent this sooner. Kim LaRocca - - is absolutely
            INCREDIBLE!!! I couldn't be more pleased with the service I have received thus far. She has taken care of
            everything. I am amazed - there is not a time that I send her an e-mail that I do not receive an immediate,
            kind and informative response. Even in the evening! Does she not take time off??? Kudos - - - Also, I am
            very excited about my new website. I love the look and the feel of it. I didn't realize how boring the look
            of my other site was. That powder blue and beige... just let me say, the impact of my new site will no doubt
            grab more attention. I'll say it for you, "you told me so" - I should have switched months ago before it
            became an emergency situation.

        </div>
        <div class="bubble">You're good, quick, and excellent! Thanks for your quick service! I've had many complements
            on my site. I really like this so much more than Informedia. The picture slide show on the listings is
            really impressive. I am getting plenty of inquiries lately. Thanks again!

        <div class="bubble">Having worked in the consulting and project management fields I was expecting my transition
            into a traditional development role to be a very challenging process. Thanks to Kim, my move into software
            development was anything but difficult. As Director of Development for my team at W2O, Kim not only
            encouraged me but empowered me to really grow and sharpen my skills as a developer. Whether it was taking
            time to personally review my code and suggest how it can be improved, providing lunch and learns on how to
            use developer tools efficiently or encouraging our team to get certifications and be our tutor for them, Kim
            has always been there to push us to do our best.
            <br><br>
            Yet, it's not just development that Kim has helped me grow in. Having a background in project management and
            business development, Kim encouraged me to really look at my strengths beyond development and find a way to
            use them to bring value to the team. Kim has always been open to hearing out my ideas on how to better
            communicate and improve processes between different teams and then work various groups to execute them. In
            this way, Kim asks me to look beyond just my code to improve a project and grow beyond just being a good
            software engineer.
            <br><br>
            Simply put, if you are looking for someone who is more than just a great developer, but a great evangelist
            and leader, look no further than Kim Larocca. She is the person you can count on to lead, motivate, and make
            sure that your team not only makes it to the finish line of any technical project but truly grow on the way
            there.

        <div class="bubble">THE WEB SITE LOOKS AWESOME! In case I haven't told you... thanks for all your hard work!
            <small>- Trey Pierson, client</small>

        <div class="bubble">Kim: Thank you for all your help on this. If all were like you life would be a lot more
            enjoyable.

        </div>
        <div class="bubble">The tool Kim built to manage the Great Deals Stores has made my job much easier. I no longer
            have to manually process excel files, create test links to send out to other teams (they are now generated
            on the fly), and it automatically checks everything to make sure it will validate in our CMS. This has been
            a huge time saver for me!
            <small>- Vijay Soppa, Web Development Team / GDS Manager</small>
        </div>
        <div class="bubble">I have closely worked with Kim for the last three years and have seen her deliver day in and
            day out. Kim has an affinity for solving business problems and pushing the boundaries on every project that
            she is assigned to. Kim was our Sr. Developer where she diligently managed and developed all of the modular
            and object-oriented frameworks utilized by the rest of the team. Kim's raw talent in development has allowed
            her to be the best developer of the team where she constantly perfected her craft. Simply put, Kim was my
            go-to-developer for many of the larger Toys"R" Us initiatives that needed to be developed in a time crunch.
            <br> The 2016 Big Book Toy Finder, for example, came down to the wire and it was only possible because of
            Kim's development efforts. Her tenacious mindset towards the project ensured that it launched on time while
            wearing many hats from the backend tool that ingested the data, to the front-end code that powered the web
            application. This experience generated more than 5.2M which surpassed everyone's expectations.
            <br>
            There are many great things I can say about Kim and her impeccable work ethic. She is a hard worker, team
            player, team builder, knowledgeable and overall a well-rounded developer. I highly recommend Kim as she is a
            rockstar!!!
